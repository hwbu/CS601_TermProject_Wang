#Term project
##Table of contents

- Introduction
This project is a portfolio about me. I created 8 pages to introduce me, my background and something
I would like to share. In this project, I tried to use as many skills learned from class as possible
to show my understanding and applying of the knowledge. 

- Technology
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and DOM to design the pages and the content layout. 
All files are hosted on GitHub. 

- Configuration
The websites contains 8 pages, and each page has a side bar on the left side. There are all the links
to the other pages on the bar, giving viewer the access to all contents. 

- Discovered issue
This project has an issue on the index.html. The photos on this page are designed to have a mouseover 
function(update photo) and a mouseleave function(reset photo), but it can not work due to the program 
can not access to the main.js file. The error message says the access is "blocked by CORS policy". This 
issue happened to my assignment 4, 5 and 6 as well. I tried but still can not figure it out.
