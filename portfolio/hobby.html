            <p> There are lots of out door activities I would like to do when I am free.
            The No.1 is hiking. So lucky I am in WA state where there are tons of trails and great
            views awaiting visiters like me. I have walked some simple and medium-hard trails, 
            and are ready for the hards ones! </p>
            <p>My second most like sports is skiing. I started doing this since 2019, and every winter
            I would go to different areas for skiing. </p>
